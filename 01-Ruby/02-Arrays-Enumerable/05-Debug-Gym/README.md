## Tips & Resources
* Read about [duck typing](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). Although it allows a very light syntax, it can also induce errors in ruby program. As an illustration of duck typing, can you imagine a very simple method that will return totally different results if given a string or an integer as argument ?
