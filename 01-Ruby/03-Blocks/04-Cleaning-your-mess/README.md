## Background & Objectives
When you start with your code, you should spend some time to

- Ask yourself **what's the objective?**
- Simplify as much as you can the initial problem to **Start small - Achieve big**

If you miss these steps, it often ends up with redundant and poor code since you don't really know where you are going...

Here is a ruby function to animate your gym training. Running this program will get the following result

````
hop! One more time..
hop! hop! One more time..
hop! hop! hop! One more time..
hop! hop! hop! hop! One more time..
hop! hop! hop! hop! hop! One more time..
hop! hop! hop! hop! hop! hop! One more time..
```

The problem is that this code was written by a poor developer, who started coding without thinking... It's got lots of useless parts.
