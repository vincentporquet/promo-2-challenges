## Background & Objectives 

Here is a series of challenges to build different layouts for a blog. Of course these layouts will be usefull for building any website, not necessarily blogs ;)

The objectives of this challenge are :

* understand the `<header>`, `<footer>`, and (a bit trickier) the `<article>` and `<section>` HTML5 elements : they are all descendents of the semantically-poor `<div>` element
* understand the difference between inline and block HTML elements 
* understand the box model and the `padding` and `margin` CSS properties 
* change the `display` CSS property to change inline elements into block elements (and the other way around)

## Specs

Change the CSS (and the CSS only) to reproduce [this design](http://lewagon.github.io/showroom/Layouts/header/blog.html) :
