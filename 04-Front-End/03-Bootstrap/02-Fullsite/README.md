## Background & Objectives

The goal is to reproduce a full website containing

- A [landing page](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-demo/landing.html) (don't bother with the circle d3 animation...)
- A [sign in form](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-demo/login.html)
- A [main app](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-demo/index.html)

## Tips

You will have to create several pages, and you will see your code is not DRY. It's fine for now, but you will see that using Rails, we can introduce a template system to keep our HTML DRY.

Also, you already know Jekyll which has several pages (blog articles) and does not repeat `<head>` elements everywhere!
