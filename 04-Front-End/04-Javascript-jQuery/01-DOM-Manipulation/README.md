## Background & Objectives

You are about to write your first jQuery code. The goal of this exercise
is to re-use what you have learned throughout the CSS module about
selectors, to dynamically manipulate the web page.

We say that we manipulate the [Document Object Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) (DOM), which is
the in-memory representation of the HTML built by the browser. It is
a tree (root node, with children, and grand-children, etc.), and
you can:

- Traverse it to read a specific node
- Remove some nodes
- Add some nodes

Doing so will change what the page looks like, instantaneously, without
hitting "Refresh".

## Specs

Open the `application.js` file, you will find a list of challenges to
complete. To test your code, you can launch your local webserver:

```bash
$ serve
```

and open `http://localhost:8000` as usual.

You will see that all results are failing. Solve them from top to bottom,
and hit F5 (Refresh) each time you want to check if you've solved
an exercise.
