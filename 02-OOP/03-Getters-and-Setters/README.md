### What are getters and setters ?
Getters and setters are elementary methods to access or set the values of instance variables. Remember, at any given time, the values of an object's instance variables represent its current state. 

* Understand getters and setters reading this [Quora post](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-programming-language/What-are-setters-and-getters-in-Ruby)
* Explain it with your words to your pair

### To do
1. In the given code we defined a `Playboy` class but forgot to define getters an setters.. As a consequence, the code is not running. **Code the necessary getter or setter methods to make the errors pass.**  
2. Document yourself on `attr_reader`, `attr_writer` and `attr_accessor` helper methods => see [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5046831/why-use-rubys-attr-accessor-attr-reader-and-attr-writer) and [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4370960/what-is-attr-accessor-in-ruby)
3. Now redefine your accessor methods (getters / setters) in a more concise way using these helper methods.
